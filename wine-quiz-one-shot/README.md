# Wine Quiz — One‑Shot Pages

This repo is ready to publish **in one step**. The included GitHub Actions workflow deploys the `docs/` folder to **GitHub Pages** automatically on every push to `main`.

## One‑Shot Instructions
1. Create a new repo on GitHub (e.g., `wine-quiz`), empty.
2. Upload all these files/folders at once (keep the `.github/workflows/pages.yml` path intact).
3. Commit to `main`. The workflow will run automatically.
4. Go to the repo’s **Actions** tab → open the latest **Deploy to GitHub Pages** run.
5. The public URL is shown near the top as the **deployment URL** (and in the Environments panel).

Your quiz will be live at a URL like: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`
